Instructions:
"With the extended deadline, I would like a 1-2 page single spaced paper on time management and planning as applied to CS/DS projects. 
This would involve finding 2-3 useful articles or resource, then synthesizing and critically responding to the information you find.
I know we talked about possible adjustments for the course structure of DWD in the future to better incorporate project planning time.
I think it would be helpful for you to think about what you would do if dealing with a project of similar scope in the future, either 
in a class or in a job. What would you do differently? What resources would you use to set deadlines and judge the amount of time things
would take? How do you balance multiple projects or commitments over a long period of time?"
